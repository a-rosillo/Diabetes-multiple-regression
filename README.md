# Diabetes-multiple-regression

Demonstration of the scikit-learn multiple regression tools.

## Outline
In this project I will predict a personâ€™s progression in diabetes with respect to various attributes about them. I will do this by:
- Generating training and test sets
- Investigating the necessity for scaling or normalization of the data.
- Generating a multiple linear regression model
- Generating predictions for the test set.
- Computing R-squared to assess the validity of the model.
